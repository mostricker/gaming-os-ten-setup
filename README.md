# GamingOS 10 Setup

This is a collection of registry hacks and other scripts.

Use them to create a clean, reproducible, and (mostly) unobtrusive GamingOS 10 installation.

## Included Scripts:

* activate-photo-viewer-win10.reg - lets you view the photo viewer just like you've always used from previous versions
* disable-auto-reboot.reg - prevents your computer from automatically restarting due to windows updates
* disable-cortana.reg - gets rid of the voice search service on your desktop
* disable-hibernate.bat - disables the hibernate feature (useful if you have an SSD)
* disable-monitor-sticky-edges.reg - remove the mouse stickiness between monitors and mouse getting stuck in corners between monitors
* require-cad.reg - you can only login with Ctrl+Alt+Delete keyboard combination
* time.reg - switch your NTP server to ntp.org
